            <p> I am a researcher with expertise in <b>intelligent decision-making for transportation and logistics</b>. I currently work as a Lead Research Scientist at <a href = "https://lacuna.ai/" target="_blank">Lacuna</a>, where I develop algorithms and digital tools for real-time transportation policies such as curb management or traffic control. Please peruse these blog posts to know more about some of my work at Lacuna: <a href="https://www.lacuna.ai/blog/digital-infrastructure-solves-chronic-transportation-problems" target="_blank">inferring</a> and <a href="https://www.lacuna.ai/blog/the-brains-behind-how-digital-infrastructure-solves-chronic-airport-congestion-part-deux" target="_blank">mitigating</a> airport congestion, and <a href="managing the curbside dynamically" target="_blank">managing the curbside dynamically</a>. I have also represented Lacuna at numerous invited talks for both industry and academic audiences (please see the Resume tab for details) </p>

            <p>I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science (specializing in Artificial Intelligence) from Stanford University.
            I worked with
            <a href="http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer </a> at the
            <a href="http://sisl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory </a>
            and <a href="https://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/jbohg" target="_blank"> Prof. Jeannette Bohg </a> at the <a href="http://iprl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Interactive Perception and Robot Learning Lab</a>.
            In my Ph.D. research, I developed hierarchical algorithms for coordinated multi-robot networks. 
            My work was motivated by several current and future technologies, e.g, delivery drone routing with ground-based transit
            vehicles as temporary modes of transportation.
            Please refer to this  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3csz980">BBC Digital Planet</a> episode (about 14 minutes in) or this <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/03/stanford-lab-envisions-delivery-drones-that-save-energy-by-taking-the-bus/" >VentureBeat</a> article if you are interested.

        	<p>I received an MS from the <a href="http://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Institute</a> of
                <a href="http://www.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2017. There, I was a member of the <a href="https://personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Personal Robotics Lab</a> and advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~siddh/" target="_blank">Prof. Siddhartha Srinivasa </a>. I worked primarily on anytime sampling-based motion planning algorithms that I validated on HERB (the Home Exploring Robotic Butler), the lab's robot and research platform. Prior to joining CMU, I graduated with a B.Tech degree in <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank"> Computer Science and
                Engineering </a> from the <a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>.

            <p> I am the immensely proud younger brother of <a href="http://www.sanjibanchoudhury.com/" target="_blank">Sanjiban Choudhury</a>, who has shaped my understanding of research, robotics, and many other more important things.
