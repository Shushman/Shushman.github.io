                <p>
                    I am an applied Artificial Intelligence researcher with deep expertise across techniques such as foundation models, decision-making, and multi-agent systems, as well as domains including geospatial inference, autonomous networks, and mobility and transportation systems.

                <p>
                    Currently, I am an AI Software Engineer at Google Research, where I develop foundational models and world-scale applications that advance our understanding of the built environment. I have worked on both fundamental research and impactful cross-functional solutions with Google Maps, Sustainability, Ads, and other teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was previously Research Lead at Lacuna Technologies, where I developed inference and optimization algorithms to enhance urban transportation. During my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University, I conducted award-winning research in multi-agent decision-making for large-scale autonomous networks (covered by the BBC and Venture Beat).
