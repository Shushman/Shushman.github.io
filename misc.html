            <h4> Technology Policy</h4>

            I have collaborated extensively with multiple interdisciplinary teams at
            the Stanford Law School on technology policy issues. In one project, our team <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/courses/policy-practicum-reforming-interpols-governance-model/" target="_blank">advised INTERPOL</a> on
            coordinating with private sector entities (particularly tech companies) to better combat
            transnational organized crime. In another, we  reported to the Administrative Conference of the United
            States Government on the <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/press/stanford-policy-lab-explores-government-use-of-artificial-intelligence-2/" target="_blank">usage of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</a> by federal agencies.

            <h4>Outreach</h4>

            Over the summer of 2018, I was a Stanford University host in the <a href="https://join.igniteducation.org/">Ignited
            Summer Fellowship</a>, which connects school teachers to researchers. I worked with a mathematics teacher at Sequoia High School to put together a number of robotics-inspired exercises for algebra and trigonometry classes.<br><br>

            I served on the Leadership Team
            of <a href="https://eswusa.org">Engineers for a Sustainable World</a>, a US-based 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.
            In my role as <a href="https://eswusa.org/drupal/profiles/shushman-choudhury">Content Coordinator</a>, I worked
            on creating articles, videos and other miscellaneous content to promote ESW and increase engagement.<br><br>


            At CMU I was a member of Tech4Society, a group of graduate students who came together
            to put their skills to use for socially beneficial projects outside just their own research.
           I worked with the organizers of the <a href = "https://datarescuepgh.wordpress.com/"
            target = "_blank"> Data Rescue Pittsburgh </a> event, which was the Pittsburgh leg of a nationwide
            series of hackathons. The goal was to retrieve and backup sensitive climate data whose original hosts were under
            threat. I helped with the event planning and logistics, coordinated with
            several involved organizations and also led one of the tracks of the event. <br><br>

            I volunteered for the <a href = "http://www.hear-me.net/home" target="_blank"> HEAR ME </a> project in Spring 2016, an initiative by CMU's CREATE lab about gender bias in STEM fields. I interviewed children of the ALEC centre in Pittsburgh, helped edit several other interviews for circulation, and published a <a href="http://hearme.posthaven.com/a-trip-to-alec" target="_blank">blog post</a> to spread awareness. <br><br>
